    <h2>1. Independence and Low Maintenance</h2>
    <p>Cats are independent and do not require constant attention, making them perfect for busy people. They can entertain themselves and are content with solitude, unlike dogs that need companionship and supervision.</p>

    <h2>2. Cleanliness and Grooming Habits</h2>
    <p>Cats are naturally clean, constantly grooming themselves. They are easy to litter-train and require less effort to maintain compared to dogs, who often need baths and emit odors.</p>

    <h2>3. Quiet Companions</h2>
    <p>Cats are generally quieter than dogs, making them ideal for apartment living. Their soft meows and purrs are soothing and much less disruptive than barking or howling.</p>

    <h2>4. Space Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Cats are perfect for small living spaces as they do not need large yards to roam. Their small size and adaptability make them ideal companions for city dwellers.</p>

    <h2>5. Fewer Behavioral Problems</h2>
    <p>Cats are generally calm, sleep a lot, and present fewer behavioral issues compared to dogs. They do not chew furniture or suffer from separation anxiety, making them stress-free pets.</p>
